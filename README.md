# GaussianNeuralNet
Simple neural network to identify the width of a Gaussian distribution

I include files to generate training, test, and validation data (GaussianGenerator), to fit the gaussian distributions (for performance comparison) (Gaussian Fit), to train the network (no hidden layers currently) (logistic), to re-train a network with preset initial conditions (logistic_pretrain), to test the network's performance (TestAnalysis), and to unpack the parameters for easy analysis(UnpackParams)

I include the test, training, and validation data from the last iteration with random noise added to the Gaussian distribution
