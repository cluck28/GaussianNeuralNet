# GaussianNeuralNet
Simple neural network to identify the width of a Gaussian distribution

I include files to generate training, test, and validation data, to fit the gaussian distributions (for performance comparison), to train 
the network (no hidden layers currently), to re-train a network with preset initial conditions, to test the network's performance and to 
unpack the parameters for easy analysis
